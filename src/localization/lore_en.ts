Basic Geography of Agnir (as Known by a Commoner)
Kadera:

A major trade city, ruled by Manticore.
A place of business, opportunity, and danger.
People from other cities come here for trade and work.
Luran & Portvel:

Also controlled by Manticore.
Luran is a smuggler’s haven, known for luxury goods and crime.
Portvel is a major port city, but strange rumors circulate about Manticore’s experiments in the docks.
Stifa (Destroyed):

Burned down by draconids in the invasion.
People believe it’s now a ghost town, cursed and haunted.
Some say strange things happen near the ruins, like hearing voices on the wind.
Arktown (Destroyed):

Once a great city of mages and scholars.
Destroyed in a magical catastrophe—many blame arrogant mages.
The ruins are now a zone of unstable magic, full of monsters and curses.
"Step too close, and you'll never return."
Bokadar (Destroyed):

A city that burned to the ground along with its dwarven prisoners.
Many believe it was the draconids who did it, but others whisper that Manticore played a role.
Common Knowledge & Beliefs About the Peninsula
Manticore Rules Everything:

They are the real power behind Kadera, Luran, and Portvel.
You don’t cross them, question them, or talk too much about them.
The Draconids Were Monsters:

Most common folk believe draconids were savage invaders.
It is said they burned entire towns, ate people, and tortured prisoners.
Some suspect Manticore worked with them at first, but no one says it openly.
Magic is Dangerous:

Magic destroyed Arktown and left behind a cursed wasteland.
Mages are untrustworthy—they either go mad or attract bad luck.
"Only fools play with magic."
The Aktarine Crystal is Cursed:

Some know that it can trap souls, but most think it just causes horrible mutations.
People whisper that Manticore is using it for dark experiments in Portvel.
Agnir Is a Land of Opportunity & Death:

Merchants and mercenaries can make a fortune here.
But life is short, and power changes hands violently.
If you want to live long, keep your head down and your pockets full.
Superstitions & Local Rumors
"The ruins of Stifa whisper at night."

Some say they can hear voices calling in the burned-out ruins.
A few travelers have disappeared near the area.
"Manticore breeds monsters in Portvel."

Dockworkers say they see strange creatures at night, but no one asks questions.
"The Aktarine Mist makes men mad."

"A god walks in the shadows."

Some whisper of a powerful being named Sigmar, trapped but growing stronger.
Cultists are said to worship him in secret.
"Rok’s empire doesn’t care about us."

The Kingdom of Rok technically rules Agnir, but the nobles never come here.

A Common Person’s View on Survival in Agnir
Never trust a mage.
Avoid the ruins of Arktown and Stifa.
Don’t ask about Manticore’s business.
Gold solves most problems—but Manticore decides who gets rich.
If you see something strange, walk the other way.

The New Gods of Rok (Most Popular in Cities)
These gods were brought to Agnir by missionaries from Rok. Over time, they became the dominant religion in Kadera, Luran, and Portvel. Most temples, shrines, and holy symbols in the city are dedicated to these gods.

The Major Gods of Rok:
Miruël – God of Knowledge

Patron of scholars, scribes, and those who seek wisdom.
People in Kadera say, "Miruël sees all, even the things we try to hide."
Some whisper that he favors mages, which makes people uneasy.
Vastissa – Goddess of Life

Also seen as a healer and mother figure.
In some places, she is merged with the old elven goddess Valissia.
Some women pray to her for healthy children and good harvests.
Ishnel – God of Light (Symbol: A Star)

Protector against darkness, chaos, and evil.
Knights and city guards often swear by him.
Priests say he opposes Manticore’s rule, but Manticore tolerates his worship—for now.
Kolirut – God of Nature

Honored by farmers and herbalists.
Few city folk worship him, but travelers carry charms in his name for safe journeys.
Brokon – God of the Elements

Fishermen, miners, and sailors make offerings to him.
Some believe he controls storms and earthquakes.
Chiva – God of Trickery

Thieves and smugglers whisper his name but do not build temples.
Some believe Manticore secretly favors him.
People joke, "If you lost your purse, thank Chiva."
Krostor – God of War

Soldiers and mercenaries offer him blood before battle.
Gladiators and pit fighters often wear his mark.
Some say Manticore’s enforcers pray to him before a killing.
Common Views on the New Gods:
"They brought order, but they didn’t stop Manticore."
"They say Miruël loves wisdom, but only the rich get to read his books."
"Ishnel’s light doesn’t reach the alleys at night."
The Old Beliefs (Fading, but Not Forgotten)
Before Rok’s missionaries came, the people of Agnir worshiped spirits, idols, and nature gods. In some villages and among the older folk, these beliefs still survive.

Surviving Old Beliefs:
Valissia – The Elven Goddess of Day and Night

Old elven belief, now mostly forgotten.
Some still say, "Valissia’s eyes see what men try to hide."
Some mix her with Vastissa, believing they are the same goddess.
Elemental Worship (Dwarves & Old Folk)

Dwarves worship the four elements, but few dwarves remain in Agnir.
Some miners and blacksmiths still honor the elements with simple prayers.
The Spirits of the Land

Farmers and older folk once honored spirits of rivers, forests, and mountains.
Some still leave offerings at crossroads for protection.
Common Views on the Old Gods:
"My grandmother swore by the river spirits. I just swear."
"The new gods build temples, but the old ones never needed them."
"Only fools anger the spirits, even if the priests say they don’t exist."
Other Gods & Forbidden Beliefs
Not all gods are safe to worship in public. Some are feared, whispered about in dark corners.

Sigmar – The New God
Rumors tell he was once a man, now a god—Sigmar was a powerful mage who ascended, not vanished. His followers are hunted, yet they persist, knowing the truth: he never left.
From the shadows, he watches.
Some cultists whisper:
"Sigmar is waiting. When he rises, the false gods will burn."
The War Gods of the Orcs
Some orcs still follow their violent, bloodthirsty gods.
The most feared is Mruuk-Hash, the Skull-Taker, who demands blood and war.
Humans don’t worship these gods, but mercenaries and killers sometimes carry orcish charms.
The Sleeping One – A Name Not Spoken
Few know the truth, but dark rumors say "something" has awakened.
Some believe the increase in demon sightings is connected to an ancient power.
People fear speaking of it, believing even mentioning its name invites doom.
Common Views on Dark Gods & Forbidden Worship:
"Sigmar’s name is cursed. Only the desperate follow him."
"Orcs pray to war, and war answers."
"They say a new god stirs beneath the world. If that’s true, we’re all doomed."
Final Thoughts: What a Commoner Believes
A regular person in Kadera is not deeply religious, but they respect the gods enough to avoid angering them. Their prayers are simple, practical, and focused on survival.

A Kaderan’s Typical Religious Practices:
Lighting a candle for Ishnel when traveling at night.
Offering a coin to Chiva before gambling.
Tossing a fishbone into the sea for Brokon before a storm.
Never speaking of Sigmar or the Sleeping One.
