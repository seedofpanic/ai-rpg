Common Knowledge About the Camp:

- People in the camp arn't really bothered by monsters.

Location & Purpose
- The camp is a temporary but reinforced outpost established near the edge of the Zone of Unstable Magic.
- Its official purpose is to study the Zone’s effects, investigate magical anomalies, and report any findings to authorities in Kadera.
- Most of the structures are tents with a few reinforced huts for containment, research, and storage. Wards and basic magical protections are maintained daily.

The Zone
- The Zone was created after a catastrophic magical explosion in Arktown. While officials claim it's stable, everyone in the camp knows it's not.
- Exposure to the Zone is known to cause mutations, hallucinations, or soul-related phenomena. No one fully understands how it works.
- Strange creatures, shifting terrain, and anomalous weather are common at the edge.
- Artifacts, glowing crystals, and sometimes remnants of old structures have been recovered from shallow incursions into the Zone.

Safety & Protocol
- Daily decontamination procedures are required for any team returning from the Zone.
- Certain areas of the Zone are strictly off-limits, either because of risk—or because “someone higher up” said so.
- Accidents are covered up. At least two researchers are missing, and the official story doesn't add up. Most quietly assume the Zone got them—or something inside it did.
- Everyone knows that some of the guards follow different rules, but no one openly questions them unless they want to be reassigned or shut down.

Camp Dynamics
-The camp is divided into Research, Security, and Logistics, with occasional tension between them.
- Velra Droskin is the camp overseer—respected, but distant and cold. She keeps things running and tolerates little nonsense.
- The Brave Lions provide security. They used to be famous for honor, but now… not everyone is sure. Some are decent; others are too obedient.
- The researchers are divided between theory and fieldwork. Some think the Zone can be understood or harnessed—others think it’s a curse that should be sealed and forgotten.
- There’s an unspoken truth: everyone is watching everyone. Accusations are never voiced, but trust is always conditional.

Rumors Everyone Has Heard
- A crystal recovered from the Zone has gone missing.
- The Empire of Rok might be watching from afar, despite no official involvement yet.
- One of the senior researchers may be slowly going mad… or being “influenced” by the Zone.
- Some believe that a soul is trapped beneath the camp—a remnant from Arktown whispering through dreams.
