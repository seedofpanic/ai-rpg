            <li><strong>Ancient Ruins</strong>: Mysterious stone ruins covered in strange symbols. Some say they hold ancient magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Cave System</strong>: A network of dark caves that wind deep into the mountains. Strange noises echo from within.</li>
            <li><strong>Swamp</strong>: A murky swamp filled with twisted trees and mysterious lights. The air is thick with fog.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>World Lore</h3>
